# Learn Agentic AI: From Low-Code to Code
*Build production-grade agents with OpenAI AgentKit, the Apps SDK, Agents SDK and MCP*

**Why this course:** Most teams can prototype agents; few can run them reliably in production. This course closes that gap—fast prototyping, then rigorous engineering.
**You will learn:** workflow design, tool integration, memory/RAG, evaluation, safety, and production operations.
**You will build:** a real agent, observable, testable, and deployable.

## One-line promise

Go from drag-and-drop agent flows to code-first apps, shipping a real, instrumented agent in production.

## Who it’s for

Developers, solution architects, and technical PMs who want to ship agentic applications quickly, then harden them with code, tests, and ops.

## Prerequisites

* Comfortable with Python
* Basic APIs, Git


## Learning outcomes

By the end, learners can:

1. Prototype agents visually
2. Extend with custom tools in code
3. Add memory/RAG & evals
4. Enforce safety & observability
5. Package, deploy, and monitor

## Syllabus

1. **Prompt and Context Engineering** see chapter 1
2. **Agentic Foundations** — agent patterns, tools, planning, evals; set up envs. *Lab:* reproduce a simple task-automation agent.
3. **Low-Code with AgentKit** — visual workflows, multi-agent orchestration, data IO. *Lab:* customer-support triage agent.
4. **Apps SDK Basics (Code-First)** — project scaffolding, tool contracts, UI wiring. *Lab:* add a custom tool to call an external REST API.
5. **Tools & Integrations** — auth patterns, rate limits, retries, streaming. *Lab:* build a data-fetch + transform tool (CSV → DB).
6. **Memory & Retrieval** — ephemeral vs long-term memory; RAG pipelines; chunking & grounding. *Lab:* private knowledge assistant.
7. **Evaluation & Safety** — task success metrics, regression suites, guardrails. *Lab:* write evals; catch prompt regressions.
8. **Ops & Observability** — logging, traces, costs, latency; blue/green rollouts. *Lab:* instrument and dashboard your agent.
9. **Packaging & Deployment** — Dockerization, config, CI; cloud deploy. *Lab:* deploy a minimal production stack.

## Three learning tracks

* **Track A: Low-Code First** — build end-to-end in AgentKit, then add code “escape hatches.”
* **Track B: Code-First** — start in Apps SDK, then import visual flows where helpful.
* **Track C: Full-Code** - [Learn Agentic AI using OpenAI Agents SDK and MCP](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai)

## Capstone (2–3 weeks or final sprint)

**“Agent-in-Production”**
Build an agent that: (a) uses at least one external tool/API, (b) has memory/RAG, (c) includes evals + safety checks, and (d) ships with dashboards.
**Rubric (100 pts):** correctness 25, reliability 20, UX 15, safety 15, observability 15, docs 10.

## Assessment kit

* 4 autograded labs (pass/fail + short reflections)
* 1 midterm mini-project (tools + memory)
* Final capstone demo with evaluator checklist

## What students ship (portfolio)

* A working agent app repo (low-code + code)
* Eval suite + safety policy
* Deployed instance with logs/metrics
* Short architecture readme
